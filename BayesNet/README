Bayes Network Project

HOW TO RUN:
  from the PythonScripts directory, run `python bayesnet.py`

APPROACH:
  I began by writing some helper functions for retrieving information from the dictionaries used to hold the dataset.  I then began writing the g function.  I used some test data
  from the example in the power point slides in order to test that my functions were working correctly.  Once I had the g function working I began writing the K2 algorithm.
  I used the same test set for this function.  Once I had functionality in place to create the network, I wrote a recursive function to return a list of all possible combinations of
  parent values for the classifier portion to use and a helper function to find the matching parent combination.  I then wrote the a function to classify a test record.  Once all of this
  functionality was in place I wrote the 10 fold cross validation component.

EXTRA CREDIT:
  I was able to complete both extra credit portions. I had a similar drop in accuracy (from .993 to about .91) as mentioned in the project
  description after bootstrapping the data.  When I implemented functionality to try several different orderings and pick the network with the highest score,
  the accuracy did not significantly improve unless I tried every possible permutation of the columns. Note that there are variables `try_random_orderings`  and
  `num_k2_random_orderings` on line 31 and 32 in bayesnet.py that allows you to try different orderings and set how many random orderings to try for the belief network.
  this is turned off at the moment but can employ this functionality by settings `try_random_orderings` to `True`.
