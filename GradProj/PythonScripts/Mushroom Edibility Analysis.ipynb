    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this study analysis is performed on edibility of mushrooms.  The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository located at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom.  The classifications are: edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended.  The only classifications that show up in the dataset are edible or definitely poisonous. Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbor, and Bayes Netowork classifiers are used."

    "The data will be randomly permuted and split into test records and training records. Each classifier will learn from the training data and classify the test data.  The classifiers will each be run 10 times with randomly picked test and training sets."
