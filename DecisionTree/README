I began by reading in the data.  I then wrote a function to calculate the entropy in a given set of data.
From here I began to work on a function to calculate the information gain from an attribute.
Once this component was working I began to write the id3 algorithm.  I ended up using a dictionary to label
the edges in the tree so that attribute values could be followed.  After running into issues I changed
my code to use a dictionary as a tree instead of a custom class.  After making this change my accuracy
went up to 90% so there was some issues caused by the tree class implementation.  By removing the 3 lowest
information gain attributes I was able to increase my accuracy to 91.43%.
